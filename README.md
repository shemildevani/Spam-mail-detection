# Spam mail detection

## Overview
Spam detection identifies unsolicited and potentially harmful emails such as advertisements, phishing attempts, and fraudulent messages.

## Importance
- Reduces unwanted emails  
- Protects against malware  
- Secures personal information  

## Techniques Used
- Content-based filtering  
- Blacklists / Whitelists  
- Bayesian filtering  
- Machine Learning  

## Machine Learning Approach
Machine learning models learn patterns from email data and adapt to new spam techniques more effectively than rule-based systems.

## Key Concepts
- Feature extraction  
- Supervised and unsupervised learning  
- Hybrid models  
- Real-time detection  
- Model evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)  

## Conclusion
Machine learning provides an efficient and adaptive solution for email spam detection and continues to improve with evolving data and techniques.
